Introduction
============

![Looking oft yonder.](/images/paul.png)

Characterizing Belief Truth Conditionally
=========================================

Just to test some styles, **this text will be bold**, and *this text
will be italicized*. *To emphasize*, probably also in italics, the point
is well made.

[I cannot recommend underlining stuff, since I often find it gets
formatted incorectly, and markdown does not support it, although you may
embed some HTML]

As Gettier says, "This is how to quote properly the LaTeX way"
[Gettier, 1963].

And note too that the word 'black' is itself black. Note in addition
that the previous sentence is true. Let me tell you son, this has some
implications which will presently be addressed, once the debt collectors
quit stopping by.

I get to lists in the [list](#list)section.

More Details
------------

Formating
=========

The details that were promised are hereby delivered, in spades and unto
the end of the age.

Basically, Ayer, 1956 believes lists are pretty cool.

Another big shot who thinks this is cool, happens to wear a fedora
[Chisholm, 1957].

I am about to start creating videos and uploading them to my [YouTube][1] channel. Subscribe if you like what you see here, because I aim to make my videos at least as informative as my articles. My old (bloated) blog is found at [paulritterbush.com][2], and its content will be imported here and it will be shutdown.
