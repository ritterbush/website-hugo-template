# website-hugo-template


This generates the basic layout of my site using the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [mainroad theme](https://github.com/Vimux/mainroad), which is quite modified.

Look into Hugo on your own if you wish to modify my site. 

###### Steps:

* Install hugo
* git clone this repo into some folder

From the terminal:
* #cd path/to/somefolder
* #hugo -D
* #./post-hugo.sh

The latter is a bash script that runs a sed replacement for the index.html files of the articles, to have the article's pdfs open.

Now the the public folder is a self-contained and usable website. I used this here Github (Netify) to host it for free.
