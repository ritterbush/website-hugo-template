I am about to start creating videos and uploading them to my [YouTube][1] channel. Subscribe if you like what you see here, because I aim to make my videos at least as informative as my articles. My old (bloated) blog is found at [paulritterbush.com][2], and its content will be imported here and it will be shutdown.
